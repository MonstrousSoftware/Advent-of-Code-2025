# Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions for the full advent of code 2025 (all 12 days).
See https://adventofcode.com/2025

Written in Java without any further libraries.

Most solutions run in under a second. Day 8 takes 4 seconds.

This repo does not contain the input files in order to follow AoC rules.
Input files need to be added to the data folder as day1.txt, day2.txt, etc. The sample data
is provided as day1a.txt, etc.
