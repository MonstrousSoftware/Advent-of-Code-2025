# Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions for the full advent of code 2025 (all 12 days).
See https://adventofcode.com/2025

Written in Java without any further libraries.

All solutions run in under a second.

This repo does not contain the input files, as requested by the AoC.
Input files need to be added to the data folder as day1.txt, day2.txt, etc. 
The sample data from the descriptions are provided as day1a.txt, etc.
